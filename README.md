This repository consolidate more than 400 [OmniGraffle](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnigraffle) artefacts that I have collected and used over the years.

Your stencils and templates library does not have to be unique, everyone strives for consistency. Fork this repository and improve *your* library. Even better, send me an update :)

I also have electronic stencils, and related to IT Methodologies including ADAPT v3, Archimate, BPMN, C4, CORAS, CMMN, DMN, IDEF5, and UML.

I normalize filenames to keep my sanity:
 * Replace all dashes and underscores with a space
 * Add the vendor name as prefix
 * Add the version as suffix

Obviously, I don't remember all the sources. The usual suspect are the vendors websites.

I try to keep them as _fresh_ as possible by manually accessing the vendors website on a regular basis. Refer to [Stencils](stencils.md) for more information.

If you don't find something, try third party commercial shape vendors such as [3DN](https://3d-networking.com/3d-symbols/), [NetZoom](www.NetZoom.com), [Shape Source](www.shapesource.com), [Visimation](www.visimation.com), or [Visio Café](http://www.visiocafe.com/).

## Installation

1. make install, it will copy newer stencils, templates, and scripts to $HOME/Library/Containers/com.omnigroup.OmniGraffle7.MacAppStore/Data/Library/Application\ Support/The\ Omni\ Group/OmniGraffle

If you prefer installing one specific stencil:

1. Double click on the stencil file, it will open in Omnigraffle
2. You can then move the stencil to make it available for future use
